# Evaluation of a city-wide school-located influenza vaccination program in Oakland, California with respect to race and ethnicity: a matched cohort study

This repository contains data and replication scripts for an evaluation of the Shoo the Flu program, a city-wide school-located influenza vaccination program, with respect to race and ethnicity.

In this evaluation, we assessed the program's impact on vaccination coverage among school aged children (`vaxcov`) and community-wide hospitalizations (`hospitalizations`). The directory structure for each subanalysis is described in the respective subdirectories.
